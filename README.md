🚗 Car Price Prediction Model

This project aims to predict used car prices using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains various car features such as:

Brand, Type, Gearbox, Fuel Type, Color, Status

Age, Kilometers Driven, Engine Size, Seating Capacity

And the Target: Car Price

🔍 Workflow

Data Cleaning (null values, duplicates, feature dropping)

Exploratory Data Analysis using Seaborn & Matplotlib

Feature Encoding (OneHotEncoding, Scaling)

Model Training & Evaluation

🤖 Models Used :-
